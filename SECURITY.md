# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, email the maintainer listed in `pyproject.toml` with:
- a description of the problem and its potential impact
- steps to reproduce
- any suggested remediation steps

We aim to acknowledge reports within 5 business days.
